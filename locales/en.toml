People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that's great! But it's %1$s and chat is neither of those things. For most people, typing is much slower than talking. So despite best intentions, **you're actually just making the other person wait** for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity (and kinda annoying).

The same goes for:

- "Hey, are you around?"
- "hi sophie - quick question."
- "You got a sec?"
- "yt?"
- "ping"
- etc.

**Just ask the question!** 😫"""

example.good.body = """If you feel it's a bit brusque to simply say "Hey" and ask the question, **you can still preface your message with as many pleasantries as you see fit.**

For example:

- "hey man, what's up? also, any idea when that thing's due?"
- "Hi there! Hope you're well. I'm after the latest deck, when you get a sec :)"
- "hey, if you're not busy, could you update those NFRs?"
- etc.

It may seem trivial, but asking your question before getting that initial salutatory reply also allows for **asynchronous communication**. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hey" and wondering what they missed.

When done right - everyone's happy! 🎉"""
